# Online Library Management System

## Project Overview
The **Online Library Management System** is designed to automate and streamline the management of books, members, and borrowing transactions in a library. This system enhances efficiency by providing an intuitive interface for both librarians and members.

## Features
### For Librarians:
- Manage book inventory (add, update, delete books).
- Maintain member records.
- Track borrowing and return transactions.

### For Members:
- Search for available books.
- Borrow and return books.
- View borrowing history.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL

## Installation

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed.
2. A web server like **Apache Tomcat**.
3. **MySQL** database server.
4. A modern web browser.

### Steps:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/online-library-management-system.git
   ```
2. Import the project into your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Configure the MySQL database:
   - Create a database using the `library_management.sql` script in the `database` folder.
   - Update the database configuration in the `config` file.
4. Deploy the application on the web server.
5. Access the application through the browser.

## How It Works
